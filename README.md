Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends
## Analysis

### Challenges 
There were no challenges encountered. However a challenge that can easily be come across is theat there are many repeatcing names of headers - or similar ones. This can lead to possible mistakes in the future. 
## Results
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Based on this analysis, the image shows that the time there were the most successful theater Kickstarters was during the summer months, peaking during the month of June at 111 successful Kickstarters. 
### Outcomes based on Goals
Based on this analysis, the lower the dollar amount the goal there more likely it is to succeed. If the kickstarter has as goal less than %15,000, there is a higher success percentage. However there were some successful Kickstarters from a higher goal bracket, $35,000 to $44,999.
## Limitations
The only outcomes looked at were looked at were: successful, failed, and canceled. There was an additonal outcome, "live" - howvere we were looking at completeled kickstarters and a liev Kickstarter is still on going.
